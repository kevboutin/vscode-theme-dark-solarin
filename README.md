## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Description

- Mainly focused on HTML5 / CSS / JS (TS) development.  
- **Not exactly same with the theme from Jetbrains IDE**. There are few modifications to match look and feel with VS Code IDE.
- Follows common textmate tokens (such as `entity.name.type`, `entity.name.function`, `variable.property`...) so try it on any languages and report issues on the GitHub repo.
- Any suggestions/contributions are welcomed!
 

## Setting

- When installation completes, select **Dark-Solarin** as your color theme (Preferences → Workbench: Color Theme → **Dark-Solarin**)

## Customizing

- If you want to customize on top of this theme, use vscode's [color customization](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme) feature.
